How-to Guides
=============

How-to guides take the reader through the steps required to solve a real-world problem.

They are recipes, directions to achieve a specific end - for example: *how to create a web form*; *how to plot a three-dimensional data-set*; *how to enable LDAP authentication*.

They are wholly **goal-oriented**.

**How-to guides are wholly distinct from tutorials** and must not be confused with them:

- A tutorial is what you decide a beginner needs to know.
- A how-to guide is an answer to a question that only a user with some experience could even formulate.
