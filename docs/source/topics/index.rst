Topic Guides
============
Discusses key topics and concepts at a fairly high level and provide useful background information and explanation.

They are a chance for the documentation to relax and step back from the software, taking a wider view, 
illuminating it from a higher level or even from different perspectives. 
You might imagine a discussion document being read at leisure, rather than over the code.
